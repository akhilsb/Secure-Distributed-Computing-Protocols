# Secure Distributed Computing Protocols

This repository implements a collection of secure distributed computing protocols that serve as building blocks for larger distributed systems. The protocols are designed to provide security guarantees in adversarial environments. 
However, this code has been written as a research prototype and has not been vetted for security. 
Therefore, this repository can contain serious security vulnerabilities. 
Use at your own risk.

## Building and Usage

This is a Rust project using Cargo. The compatibility between dependencies has been tested for Rust version `1.83.0`. To build all components:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
Run the following sequence of steps to start a protocol. 

1. **Generate Configuration Files**: This step generates the necessary configuration files for an $n$ party distributed system. 
```
mkdir testdata/
./target/release/genconfig --base_port 15000 --client_base_port 19000 --client_run_port 19500 --NumNodes 4 --blocksize 100 --delay 100 --target testdata/ --local true
```
These instructions generate configuration files for $n=4$ parties. Party $i$ runs on port `15000+i`, listens to requests on port `19000+i`, and syncs with a global synchronizer (this part is optional) on port `19500`. Please ensure the directory has been created to run this command. 

2. **Create channels and invoke protocol**: The following snippet of code illustrates a basic composition of distributed protocols. 
```rust
pub async fn spawn(config: Node)-> (anyhow::Result<oneshot::Sender<()>>, Vec<Result<oneshot::Sender<()>>>){
    // ctrbc_req_send_channel: Request sending channel, request receiving channel. The sending channel can be used to issue message requests to the RBC module. 
    // ctrbc_req_recv_channel: Request receiving channel - passed as an argument. The RBC module listens to this channel. 
    let (ctrbc_req_send_channel, ctrbc_req_recv_channel) = channel(10000);
    
    // ctrbc_out_send_channel: Output sending channel - passed as an argument. The RBC module sends outputs on this channel. 
    // ctrbc_out_recv_channel: Output receiving channel. We poll this channel to get outputs from RBC module.
    let (ctrbc_out_send_channel, mut ctrbc_out_recv_channel) = channel(10000);

    let mut statuses = Vec::new();

    let _rbc_serv_status = ctrbc::Context::spawn(
        config,
        ctrbc_req_recv_channel, 
        ctrbc_out_send_channel, 
        false
    );

    statuses.push(_rbc_serv_status);
    
    let _resp = ctrbc_req_send_channel.send(Vec::new()).await.unwrap();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            tokio::select! {
                msg = ctrbc_out_recv_channel.recv() => {
                    // Execute handling logic for the received message from the channel
                    log::debug!("Received message from CTRBC channel {:?}", msg);
                    // self.process_ctrbc_event(ctrbc_msg.1, ctrbc_msg.0, ctrbc_msg.2).await;
                }
            }
        }
    });
    let (exit_tx, _exit_rx) = oneshot::channel();
    (Ok(exit_tx), vec![])
}
```
Protocols utilize `tokio` asynchronous channels or queues to receive requests and send outputs.
Each protocol takes two `tokio` channels as input: a receiver channel from which it receives requests (`req_recv` channel), and a sender channel to which it can send outputs (`out_send` channel). 
Each protocol's invocation takes these channels as arguments. 
A prominent example of protocol composition is in `consensus/acs`. 
This folder implements an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol from Reliable Broadcast (CTRBC), Secret Key Sharing (ASKS), and Reliable Agreement (RA). 

3. **Build code and run parties**: After compiling the code, run $n=4$ parties to start the protocol. Each party waits until it establishes a tcp channel with **all** parties. 
The `scripts/test.sh` script can also be used to start all four parties locally. 


## Key Features

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
All protocols are designed to handle Byzantine faults, where up to `t` out of `n` nodes can behave arbitrarily (where typically `n â‰¥ 3t + 1`).

### Asynchronous Operation
Most protocols operate in asynchronous network models, making no assumptions about message delivery times or clock synchronization.

### Modular Design
Each protocol is implemented as a separate module with well-defined interfaces, allowing them to be composed into larger systems.

### Network Abstraction
The implementation includes a robust networking layer with:
- TCP-based reliable communication
- Message acknowledgments
- Automatic connection management


## Applications

These protocols serve as building blocks for:
- Distributed ledgers and blockchains
- Secure asynchronous multi-party computation protocols
- Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication

## Research Context

This implementation is part of ongoing research in secure distributed computing, focusing on practical implementations of theoretically sound protocols that can handle adversarial conditions in distributed systems.
